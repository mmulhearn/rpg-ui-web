# RPG
The goal of RPG is to create a browser-based RPG.  The initial development will be to support D&D but it should be architected to allow future expansion into other RPGs.

## Technology
- Web: SPA, either Angular or React
- Communication: HTTP polling or web sockets (if web sockets can be done very cheaply)
- Server: .NET Core
- Data Stores: Cosmos?

## Features

## Architecture

## Work Management
Azure DevOps will be used to track work items for feature development.

## Contributing
Cut branch, develop, PR back into `main`.

## CI/CD
While currently disabled, AzureDevops CI/CD pipelines will probably be used.
